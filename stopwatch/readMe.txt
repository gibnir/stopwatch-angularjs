stopwatch exercise
==================
Build a stopwatch having those features:
*	The stopwatch will have 6 digits: 2 for minutes, 2 for seconds and 2 for milliseconds formatted like so: 00:00.00.
*	Both separators on the stopwatch clock will be blinking twice per second only while the stopwatch is counting.
*	There should be a start / stop button which will trigger the stopwatch counter.
*	There should be a lap button that will add the difference from the previous lap time to a table below.
*	There should be a clear button that will clear the lap table and reset the stopwatch clock.
*	Each lap record will allow to type a short description next to the time.
*	Each lap record will have a remove button next to it to allow removing single record from the table.
*	The stopwatch should store the laps table, state and clock on the local storage so that reloading the page wonâ€™t interrupt even when the stopwatch is counting.
*	The stopwatch should be scientifically accurate.
*	Try to make it look as much as you can like the example.

Technical highlights:
*	Clean code with comments.
*	Use Angular JS.
*	Do not use any external modules and libraries.
*	Use SCSS.
*	Use Gulp to compile scss and observe changes, also minify JS files.
*	Use GIT, upload the final project to GitHub (master branch) and send us a link.
